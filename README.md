As the name suggest this repository will have my OOP244 class and OOP345 project.

My OOP244 project was library management app some of the things that I learned are=

Design classes with dynamically allocated resources to model the components of a programming solution
Design member functions using logic constructs to solve tasks of linear complexity Relate classes using inheritance hierarchies to minimize the duplication of object code
Design polymorphic objects to amplify the reusability of program code
Use stream objects to interact with users and access persistent data Trace the execution of object-oriented code to validate its correctness

My OOP345 project was a simulation of an assembly line with any number of stations. Some of the things that I learned are

Design collections of model objects using sequential containers and multi-dimensional arrays to solve a systems or business problem 
Create function objects and closures to customize a programming solution for a particular application 
Model generalization and specialization using inheritance hierarchies to minimize the duplication of code
Model polymorphic behavior using interfaces, virtual functions and templates (generics) to amplify the reusability of code 
Implement design components using algorithms of the standard template library to utilize existing technologies
Create program components of quadratic complexity to solve non-linear problems 
Design program components using raw pointers and pointer arithmetic to access data in program memory Design multi-tasked solutions using threading lib
